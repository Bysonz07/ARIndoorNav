# ARIndoorNav
This is still an early prototype augmented reality indoor navigation system for the technical university of Cologne, campus Gummersbach. 
This project is currently work-in-progress.

It was created using Unity (C#) and ARCore by Google.

This project is almost finished and ready for the first "release". I'll be updating this README with more information and pictures within the next month (march 2020). 
If and how I will continue to work on this project, such as the UI design, will be determined later.
